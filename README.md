# React_TicTacToe_Game
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented using React. It allows two players to take turns clicking on squares to place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The game announces the winner when one player successfully completes a row, column, or diagonal with their marks.

The final output of the Tic Tac Toe game implemented using React will be a web-based user interface where users can play the game by clicking on the squares to place their X's or O's. Here's a description of what the final output looks like:

The game board consists of a 3x3 grid of squares.
Each square is initially empty.
Players take turns clicking on empty squares to place their X's or O's.
The game displays whose turn it is ("Next player: X" or "Next player: O").
When a player wins by completing a row, column, or diagonal with their symbol (X or O), the game announces the winner ("Winner: X" or "Winner: O").
Once a winner is determined, the game stops accepting moves and game over until it is reset.
If the game ends in a draw (i.e., no player wins), the game announces a draw.
